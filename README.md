It connects to the database using SQL to fetch the latest sales data, processes and formats the results with Python, and then delivers updates directly into the teamâ€™s Slack workspace via a Slackbot using the Slack API.
The goal is to save time, ensure consistency, and keep the team aligned with timely insights on sales trends.
